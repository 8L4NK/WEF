# ðŸ“¡ WiFi Exploitation Framework ðŸ“¡

A fully offensive framework to the 802.11 networks and protocols with different types of attacks for WPA/WPA2 and WEP, automated hash cracking, and much more.

Tested and supported in **Kali Linux**, **Parrot OS** and **Arch Linux**. If you have any error please open an issue (if you want to write it in spanish you can do it). If you have any doubt, please contact me via Discord ***D3Ext#5965***

If you don't know how wifi hacking works you can read my free course [here](https://d3ext.github.io/posts/Curso/), it's written in Spanish and I explain things from 0

*\*However it's not finished and may have issues, but if you have one, feel free to contact me and I'll try to fix it.\**

- I recommend you my alfa adapter: **Alfa AWUS036ACM**, which works really great with both, 2.4 and 5 Ghz
